# Clone SDK & Sample Code

Clone (https://www.autonomous.ai/clone-telepresence-smart-office-robot) is an Android-based robot designed by Autonomous.  It is a 4-foot tall robot, capable of moving around, running Android apps, and being controlled by a smartphone.

Clone is based on Android, so building a Clone app is the same with building an Android app.  

The Clone SDK lets developers:

* instruct Clone to move at a given speed, direction, and amount of time
* read Clone's internal sensors including velocity, battery level, bumper, and IMU
* see and hear what Clone sees & hears
